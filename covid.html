        <h4 class="card-title">Electrostatic Fogging</h4>
        <img src="images/fogging-300x300.png" class="col-md-4 float-md-start my-1 me-md-3 img-thumbnail" alt="Electrostatic Fogging">
        <p>The addition of Electrostatic Fogging equipment has advanced our COVID-19 cleaning equipment abilities at Surreel Cleaning Solutions Inc. As workplaces reopen, we know that different surfaces and equipment will be touched by many staff and customers, potentially spreading the COVID-19 virus. Electrostatic Foggers help contribute to combating the spread of COVID-19 with their ability to cover large areas while reducing labour time.</p>
        <p>Electrostatic Foggers work to kill off unwanted surface bacteria and viruses through their ability to charge different liquids of either disinfectant or sanitizers as they pass through the fogger’s system and nozzle. As a result, the Fogger provides you with a uniform coating of disinfectant that can reach a large area in 50% less time, and even cover hard to reach corners and tight spaces. With an ability to kill surface bacteria within 2 minutes while eliminating the need to wipe off equipment or surfaces manually, the Electrostatic Fogger is an efficient and rapid method of cleaning your workplace as you open back up during COVID-19. Easily adapt an Electrostatic Fogger to your desired disinfectant with its compatible 3-1 nozzle that quickly matches particle sizes.</p>
        <p>Reduce your overall cleaning time and labour costs by using an Electrostatic Fogger in your workplace to conquer the spread of COVID-19. Since this virus lingers on surfaces and can be contracted person to person through touch or droplets, we must be cautious in every aspect of business operations in the near future.

        <img src="images/handwash-300x300.png" class="col-md-4 float-md-start my-1 me-md-3 img-thumbnail" alt="Handwashing Station">
        <p>At Surreel Cleaning Solutions Inc, our focus during COVID-19 is to provide our customers with the right tools and equipment that deliver the highest levels of cleaning standards, including Portable Hand Wash Stations. Portable Hand Wash Stations help contribute to combating the spread of COVID-19 with their hands-free activation and efficient disinfectant abilities.</p>
        <p>Knowing that your employees and customers are soon to be returning to your workplace, we realize the importance of having cleaning solutions available that can be used by everyone. By installing Portable Hand Wash Stations at your establishment, you are providing individuals with the opportunity to self-disinfect as an additional protective measure against the spread of COVID-19. Our Portable Hand Wash Stations include soap and hand sanitizer, and work by using a hands-free foot pump and also feature paper towel dispensers. Ensure long-lasting disinfectant solutions for your employees and customers, as the Portable Hand Wash Station is capable of providing you with 1024 single dispenses and can hold either 16 gallons of fresh water or 19 gallons of gray water. With its paper towel dispenser capable of carrying either one roll or 500 single folded sheets, individuals can quickly and conveniently dry off their hands after every use.</p>
        <p>With a Portable Hand Wash Station in your workplace, the battle against COVID-19 will become a much easier task, since everyone can effectively disinfect their hands as soon as they enter. Since COVID-19 is spread person to person by either touch or droplets left on surfaces, we must eliminate the potential spread from our hands on to our work surfaces. By using Portable Hand Wash Stations, we can each play a part in the fight against the spread of this virus as we reopen our businesses and get back to normal operations in the near future.</p>

        <h4 class="card-title">UV-C Lights</h4>
        <img src="images/uvlights-300x300.png" class="col-md-4 float-md-start my-1 me-md-3 img-thumbnail" alt="UV-C Lights">
        <p>UV-C lights are a useful piece of disinfecting equipment that is used at Surreel Cleaning Solutions Inc as a protective measure against COVID-19. By using ultraviolet radiation, UV-C lights work to kill off unwanted microorganisms on work surfaces in an eco-friendly manner. They do so through penetrating a microorganism’s cells and damaging its nucleic acids to make it no longer active. Since the COVID-19 virus is a single positive-strand RNA virus, it does not have a complete cell structure, making it easy to kill with UV-C lights. These lights can be used on surfaces, as well as in water and air purification, to eliminate unwanted and potentially harmful microorganisms.</p>
        <p>We offer a few variations of UV-C lights in our cleaning services as effective solutions for targeting COVID-19. Our ultraviolet germicidal lamp is a 360 degree, multidirectional sanitation lamp that operates using spectral wavelengths of 454 nanometers. These lamps can immediately kill viruses, bacteria, and even mould! With a sterilization rate of at least 99%, this lamp is incredibly safe when used around animals and humans, as its micro-wave sensor will shut off the lamp automatically if it detects movement. This feature is incredibly important when using UV-C lights, as they can cause harm to humans and animals with frequent direct contact.</p>
        <p>Another UV-C light that Surreel Cleaning Solutions Inc uses to tackle COVID-19 are portable UV-C wands. These wands work great in hard to reach places, as they can disinfect areas anywhere up to 3cm to 6cm away and only take 30 seconds to kill surface bacteria! Their portable design allows for excellent user flexibility, ensuring that you can reach different places and disinfect them with safety and ease. By using light wavelengths of between 270-282 nanometers, the UV-C portable wands effectively destroy the molecular structure of DNA and RNA viruses.</p>
        <p>UV-C Bags are another addition to Surreel Cleaning Solutions Inc line of COVID-19 cleaning equipment. These bags come equipped with built-in gravity sensors and work by tilting to turn on their ultraviolet light automatically. Should you need to disinfect electrical equipment, for example, then the UV-C Bag is an excellent option for quick disinfecting of specific equipment and is incredibly safe to use as no light is exposed during the disinfection process.</p>

        <h4 class="card-title">Hydroxl Generators</h4>
        <img src="images/handwash-300x300.png" class="col-md-4 float-md-start my-1 me-md-3 img-thumbnail" alt="Handwashing Station">
        <p>Hydroxyl Generators work similarly to our sun’s UV radiation and natural ecosystem, improving air quality while eliminating potentially harmful pollutants on surfaces and in the air we breath. A chamber within Hydroxyl Generators activates a process that generates atmospheric hydroxyls that safely neutralize most natural and man-made chemicals, pathogens, odors, viruses, mildew, bacteria, and even allergens. Their ability to react with microorganisms and almost every organic chemical in the air allows Hydroxyl Generators to effectively clean the air we breathe by oxidizing and decomposing volatile organic compounds (VOCs). By using Hydroxyl Generators continuously in our work environments, we can ensure high levels of deep sanitation and constant elimination of harmful microorganisms, including COVID-19.</p>
        <p>Since the COVID-19 virus is a single positive-strand RNA virus that can be passed from person to person through surfaces or droplets, it is crucial that we make our work environments as sanitary as possible, including the air that we consume and work surfaces we use. Hydroxyl Generators have been used for safe air cleaning practices for over ten years, and can be found in many establishments, including medical facilities. Using a range of UV wavelengths below 350nm, this equipment kills microorganisms by reacting with proteins and chemicals found in their cellular membranes that results in cell leakage and death (also known as lysing). They do not require FDA approval to operate, as they function in a similar manner to the process found in nature, making Hydroxyl Generators an incredibly safe cleaning solution.</p>

<p>There are many formats that Hydroxyl Generators can be utilized in. Medical Facilities, for example, often have this technology integrated into their heating and air conditioning systems, while other workplaces may use a mobile Hydroxyl Generator. This equipment can work effectively on surfaces including stainless steel, and even food surfaces. By neutralizing the air rather than filtering it, Hydroxyl Generators can rapidly decompose harmful microorganisms, including COVID-19 in less than a second! Based on the size of your workplace, choosing the right size in Hydroxyl Generator will allow you to receive the best possible results as you reopen your business during this difficult time.</p>

<p>Whether you work in hospitality, residential, industrial, commercial, or agricultural workplaces, or even oversee disaster restoration, Hydroxyl Generators are key cleaning solutions when it comes to the fight against COVID-19. This equipment does not harm people or plants, but instead can reduce allergy symptoms alongside contaminants left on surfaces. Hydroxyl Generators also improve efficiency of workplace equipment by eliminating harsh surface chemicals that in turn can reduce potential cleaning and maintenance costs.  Hydroxyl Generators are incredibly safe and easy to use, and you won’t even notice that it is there as you go about your regular business routine.</p>

<p>By applying the advanced technological capabilities of a Hydroxyl Generator to your workplace, our team at Surreel Cleaning Solutions Inc. will ensure that this equipment is used properly and effectively. Reduce the risk of COVID-19 spreading in your work environment by choosing Hydroxyl Generators and their nature-like cleaning abilities.</p>
